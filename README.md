# GPU unlock 1.1.0

Unlock FP/BF16 instruction issue rate on consumer Nvidia 30 series cards to their professional equivalents

This Linux kernel module combines the cmpunlocker's V67/PLM technique with the pre-driver timing of the UEFI approach. It runs the unlock, writes the speed selectors (SS0 `0x88888888`, which selects the full BF16 rate, and the 4-bit SS1 `0x8` IMLA4) and performs FLR before the unmodified NVIDIA driver binds the card. It is neither a UEFI application nor a patched NVIDIA driver. 

The benefit of this early kmod driver is that it does not require manual patching each time nvidia releases a new driver version.

The effect of this unlock is that it doubles the instruction issuing speed of FP/BF16 FMA into FP32 operations on GA102, GA103, GA104 and GA106 cards.

## How to install

First run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Zagitta/gpu-unlock
cd gpu-unlock
make install
```

Then append `gpu_unlock.targets=all` to your kernel command line, keeping
existing options:

- **GRUB (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint):** add it inside `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`
in `/etc/default/grub`, then run `sudo update-grub`.
- **GRUB (Arch/CachyOS):** same edit, then run
`sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`.
- **Fedora/RHEL:** run
`sudo grubby --update-kernel=ALL --args="gpu_unlock.targets=all"`.
- **systemd-boot:** append it to the `options` line in your boot entry
(`bootctl status` shows its location).
- **UKI / generated entries:** add it to `/etc/kernel/cmdline` and regenerate
your boot images/entries (e.g. `sudo mkinitcpio -P` for mkinitcpio UKIs).

# FAQ

- Q: Does this depend on a specific driver version? I see `610.43.03` is pinned.  
A: No the driver is only fetched to extract firmware this unlock depends on    
- Q: What about Windows?  
A: I don't run windows and don't plan to maintain it but [https://github.com/impacifist/Windows-GPU-UNLOCK](https://github.com/impacifist/Windows-GPU-UNLOCK) has built a port, YMMV.    
- Q: What about Turing and Ada?  
A: There are forks with support already, I will integrate this soon.    
- Q: Does this hurt my GPU?  
A: It's very unlikely, this only unlocks a small handicap Nvidia has put in place to differentiate datacenter and professional cards from consumer versions. It may heat up your GPU slightly because it now does more compute but the standard throttling and power management remains completely intact and should downclock.    
- Q: How can I assist?  
A: Please consider [donating](#support-me) so I can purchase more GPUs <3

## Local build

Every build downloads the NVIDIA/CachyOS inputs over HTTPS and generates
firmware only in the build directory and the binary package. All three formats install through the same `make install-*`
targets. Packages are built from the working tree, uncommitted changes included.

Build, install build dependencies, and install the packages in one step
(asks for your sudo password):

```sh
make install        # detect the distribution and select an installer
make install-arch   # makepkg -sif
make install-deb    # apt-get build-dep, dpkg-buildpackage, apt-get install
make install-rpm    # dnf builddep, rpmbuild, dnf install
```

`make install` uses `/etc/os-release` (`ID`, then `ID_LIKE`) to detect Arch,
Debian/Ubuntu, or Fedora/RHEL/CentOS families. The RPM installer requires DNF.
For other distributions, select a compatible explicit target above.

`make arch`, `make deb` and `make rpm` only build. Debian and RPM packages go
to `build/deb` and `build/rpm`. The NVIDIA inputs are cached in
`~/.cache/gpu-unlock/inputs` (`make inputs`; override with `INPUTS=`).
`dpkg-buildpackage` itself never uses the network, so a clean-chroot build (sbuild or
pbuilder) needs `GPU_UNLOCK_INPUTS` pointing at that cache.
The `make dist` archive, the Debian source package and the `.nosrc.rpm`
contain no NVIDIA archives or generated firmware.

## Boot flow and opt-in

The packages put `gpu_unlock` and its firmware in the initramfs and load it
there, before `nvidia` can bind a card:

- **mkinitcpio:** `/etc/mkinitcpio.conf.d/zz-gpu-unlock.conf` inserts
`gpu_unlock` right before `nvidia` in `MODULES`, so a display card is blank
for as short a time as possible. Without `nvidia` in the image, it goes
last and still runs before an `nvidia` loaded from the root filesystem.
Images are rebuilt on install. mkinitcpio ignores drop-ins for an image
built with `-c <config>` or a preset `_config`; put `gpu_unlock` right
before `nvidia` in that config's `MODULES` yourself.
- **initramfs-tools:** `/usr/share/initramfs-tools/modules.d/gpu-unlock.conf`.
- **dracut:** `/usr/lib/dracut/dracut.conf.d/gpu-unlock.conf`.

With initramfs-tools and dracut, the module is built for every installed
kernel that has headers, and those kernels' images are rebuilt on install
and again on removal. Kernels installed later get the module and a new
image from the kernel's own install hooks.

There is no `softdep nvidia pre:` rule: kmod honours only the first
`softdep nvidia` line it reads, so other packages' rules (`nvidia-utils`,
`gddr6_hwmon`) would silently override it, or it would override theirs.

The module does nothing unless the kernel command line opts in:

```
gpu_unlock.targets=all                          # every supported unbound card
gpu_unlock.targets=0000:21:00.0                 # only these cards
gpu_unlock.targets=0000:21:00.0,0000:22:00.0    # comma-separated
```

Addresses are full PCI names as `lspci -D` prints them (hex digits in either
case), independent of GPU numbering and display role. An entry that is not
a supported recipe (GA100/GA102/GA103/GA104/GA106 or RTX 4090), including `all` mixed with addresses, is logged and ignored.
The cards are unlocked concurrently, about a second in all however many
there are, and each on its own: a card that is already bound or powered
down is skipped. Bus mastering that the board firmware left on (Supermicro
X11 does this whatever its option ROM and bus master settings) is cleared
first; a card some driver already initialised is still refused. Then
`nvidia` loads and binds every card as usual.

The display card works too. Its firmware framebuffer (the boot console and
Plymouth) keeps running while the unlock's firmware steps run, and is
removed just before the card's reset, as `nvidia-drm` would do a moment
later anyway. Its screen is blank from that reset until `nvidia-drm` takes
over.

Loading the module by hand after boot does nothing to a card that `nvidia`
has bound.

Suspend to RAM powers the cards off, which resets the speed selectors. After
resume the module unlocks every card it unlocked at boot again, before
`nvidia` resumes it: its suspend notifier runs just ahead of the one `nvidia`
resumes its cards from (`NVreg_UseKernelSuspendNotifiers=1`, the default in
current drivers; `nvidia-resume.service` runs later still). This adds about a
second to resume. A card that kept power, as in suspend to idle, is still
unlocked and is only read. A card that `nvidia` has already resumed, or that is
bound to another driver, is left as it is, and the log says why. Add
`gpu_unlock.resume=0` to the kernel command line, or write `0` to
`/sys/module/gpu_unlock/parameters/resume`, to turn this off. Hibernation is
not covered.

Check the result with:

```sh
journalctl -k -b | grep gpu_unlock
lspci -nnk -s 0000:[ID]:00.0
```

To stop unlocking, remove `gpu_unlock.targets=` from the kernel command line;
for a one-off boot, delete it in the bootloader's edit screen. Removing the
packages also removes the module and the initramfs drop-ins.

If the firmware on a card never stops, the module logs it and keeps the DMA
buffers that firmware may still use until the next power off. Power off
before trying again.

The kernel module and local packaging are GPL-2.0-only. The generated buffer
derives from the pinned CMP reference; NVIDIA firmware remains under its own
terms. See `firmware/NOTICE.md` and `licenses/` for attribution and notices.
